```{r}
library(ggplot2)
choco = read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
head(choco)
colnames(choco)
str(choco)
```
# What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?

```{r}
nrow(choco)
```
*I just looked up how many rows are in this data frame to see how many bars were in here that are rated. So, the answer is 1,852 bars are rated.*

# How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(choco, aes(x = Review.Date)) + geom_bar()
```


# How are ratings distributed? #Character type needs adjusted
```{r}

choco$rating.numeric = as.numeric(choco$Rating)
levels(choco$rating.numeric)

distribution = ggplot(choco, aes(x = rating.numeric)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=5000) +
  ggtitle("Rating Distribution")
distribution
```


# Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?
```{r}
scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating))+ geom_point()
scatter
```


#How do ratings compare across different company locations? #Error about aesthestics
```{r}
df$CL.factor = as.factor(df$Company.Location)
str(df)

locations = dplyr::filter(df, CL.factor %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
locations



box = ggplot(df, aes(x = locations, y = Rating)) +
  geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~CL.factor)
box
```

#Question 3: What company has the highest ratings?
```{r}
question_3 = ggplot(df, aes(x = Company)) + geom_bar(aes(weight = rating.numeric))
question_3
```
